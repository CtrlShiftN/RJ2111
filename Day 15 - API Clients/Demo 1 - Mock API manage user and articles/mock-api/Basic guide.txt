1. Create a react app named "demo-app", then create a new folder called "mock-api" inside the folder "demo-app". Install mock-api by command "npm i --save-dev express connect-api-mocker"
2. inside "mock-api", create a file called "app.js" with the following codes:
const express = require('express');
const apiMocker = require('connect-api-mocker');

const port = 3000;
const app = express();
 
app.use('/api', apiMocker('mock-api'));
 
console.log(`Mock API Server is up and running at: http://localhost:${port}`);
app.listen(port);
3. inside mock-api folder, create APIs like user/list/GET.json
4. After running npm run start and node mock-api/app.js in two terminals, run "localhost:3000/api/user/list" then you may see the result
or
npm i --save-dev npm-run-all
Now in your package.json, under "scripts", add the two entries:

...
"scripts": {
  ...
  "mock-api": "node ./mock-api/app.js",
  "dev": "run-p start mock-api",
  ...
},
...
package.json
This will effectively run npm run start and npm run mock-api in parallel.

Now run both using npm run dev. Your React app will now consume the mock API routes! Enjoy!
